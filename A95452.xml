            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Agreement</hi> of the People, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>HAving by our late labours and hazards made it appeare to the world at how high a rate we value our ju≈øt freedom, &amp; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øo far owned our cau≈øe, as to deliver the Enemies thereof into our hands: We do now head our ≈øelves bound in mutuall duty to each other, to take the be≈øt care we can for the future, to avoid both the danger of returning into a ≈ølavi≈øh condition, and the chargeable remedy of another war: for as it cannot be imagined that ≈øo many of our Country-men would have oppo≈øed us in this quarrel, if they had under≈øtood their own good, ≈øo may we ≈øafely promi≈øe to our ≈øelves, that when our Common Rights and liberties ≈øhall be cleared, their endeavours will be di≈øappointed, that ≈øeeke to make them≈øelves our Ma≈øters ≈øince therefore our former oppre≈ø≈øions, and ≈øcarce yet ended troubles have been occa≈øioned, either by want of frequent Nationall meetings in Councell, or by rendring tho≈øe meetings ineffectuall: We are fully agreed and re≈øolved, to provide that hereafter our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives be neither left to an uncertainty for the time, nor made u≈øele≈ø≈øe to the ends for which they are intended: In order whereunto we declare,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the people of England being at this day very unequally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtributed by Counties, Cities, and Burroughes for the election of their Deputies in Parliament, ought to be more indifferently proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the number of the Inhabitants: the circum≈øtances whereof, for number, place, and manner, are to be ≈øet down before the end of this pre≈øent Parliament. 2. That to prevent the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences apparently ari≈øing, from the long continuance of the ≈øame per≈øons in authority, this pre≈øent Parliament be di≈ø≈øolved upon the la≈øt day of September, which ≈øhall be in the yeare of our Lord, 1648.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the People do of cour≈øe chu≈øe them≈øelves a Parliament once in two yeares, viz. upon the fir≈øt Thur≈øday in every 2d. March, after the manner as ≈øhall be pre≈øcribed before the end of this Parliament, to begin to ≈øit upon the fir≈øt Thur≈øday in Aprill following at We≈øtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, or ≈øuch other place as ≈øhall be appointed from time to time by the preceding Repre≈øen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. That the power of this, and all future Repre≈øentatives of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is inferiour only to theirs who chu≈øe them, and doth extend, without the con≈øent or concurrence of any other per≈øon or per≈øons; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <list>
                     <item>1. THat matters of Religion, and the wayes of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, are not at all intru≈øted by us to any humane power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe therein we cannot remit or exceed a tittle of what our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences dictate to be the mind of God, without wilfull ≈øin: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe the publike way of in≈øtructing the Nation (≈øo it be not compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive) is referred to their di≈øeretion.</item>
                     <item>2. That the matter of impre≈øting and con≈øtraining any of us to ≈øerve in the wars, is again≈øt our freedome; and therefore we do not allow it in our Repre≈øentatives; the rather, becau≈øe money (the ≈øinews of war) being alwayes at their di≈øpo≈øall, they can never want numbers of men apt enough to engage in any ju≈øt cau≈øe.</item>
                     <item>3. That after the di≈ø≈øolution of this pre≈øent Parliament, no per≈øon be at any time que≈øtioned for any thing ≈øaid or done, in reference to the late publike differences, otherwi≈øe then in execution of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the pre≈øent Repre≈øentatives, or Hou≈øe of Commons.</item>
                     <item>4. That in all Lawes made, or to be made, every per≈øon may bee bound alike, and that no Tenure, E≈øtate, Charter Degree, Birth, or place, do confer any exemption from the ordinary Cour≈øe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall proccedings, whereunto others are ≈øubjected.</item>
                     <item>5. That as the Lawes ought to be equall ≈øo they mu≈øt be good &amp; not evidently de≈øtructive to the ≈øafety and well-being of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</item>

               <p>THe≈øe things we declare to be our native Rights, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are agreed and re≈øolved to maintaine them with our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt po≈ø≈øibilities, again≈øt all oppo≈øition what≈øoever being compelled thereunto not only by the examples of our Ance≈øtors who≈øe bloud was often ≈øpent in vain for the recovery of their Freedomes, ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them≈øelves through fraudulent Accommodations, to be ≈øtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded of the fruit of their Victories, but al≈øo by our own wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, who having long expected, and dearly earned the e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the≈øe certain rules of Government, are yet made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for the ≈øettlement of our Peace and freedome, upon him that intended our bondage, and brought a cruell Warre upon us.</p>
